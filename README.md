## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/404GH0ST/my-nvchad-configuration.git ~/.config/nvim && nvim
```
After Lazy finishes installing plugins, make sure to run `:MasonInstallAll` to install LSP stuff.

### PowerShell LSP
To fully configure the PowerShell LSP, we need to download and extract PowerShellEditorServices.zip from the [releases](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellEditorServices/releases) to `~/LSP/PowerShellEditorServices`.
